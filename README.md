# Clicky-Game

## Description

This application is a simple memorization game that allows the user to select images on the screen and try to remember which images have already been selected. Each time an image is clicked, the images are shuffled on the screen. This app uses React for the front end framework and Bootstrap for the CSS styling. React state and props are used to monitor variables when changed and update the UI. A link to the deployed github pages site can be found below.
